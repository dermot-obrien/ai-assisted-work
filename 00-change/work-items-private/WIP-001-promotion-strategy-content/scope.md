# WIP-001 Promotion Strategy and Content

## Summary

Create 3-4 promotional articles about AI-assisted work to be published as drafts on Medium and LinkedIn, including one focused on cognitive load for Enterprise Architects and 2-3 additional articles for both EA and general audiences.

## Intent

Develop high-quality content to promote the AI-assisted work product through thought leadership articles. The content will target both Enterprise Architects (addressing specific challenges like cognitive load in complex systems) and general audiences (broader topics related to AI-assisted workflows and productivity). All articles will be drafted to a review-ready state but not published as part of this work item.

> **AI Agents**: See [`scope-ai.md`](scope-ai.md) for intent formation history, decision rationale, and agent-specific instructions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Enterprise Architect cognitive load article drafted and ready for review
- [ ] 2-3 additional articles (mix of EA-focused and general audience) drafted and ready for review
- [ ] All articles are formatted appropriately for Medium and LinkedIn platforms
- [ ] Articles effectively communicate the value proposition of AI-assisted work

## Scope

### In Scope

- Research article topics and angles that resonate with target audiences
- Draft 1 Enterprise Architect-focused article on cognitive load
- Draft 2-3 additional promotional articles (mix of EA and general audience topics)
- Format articles for Medium and LinkedIn publication
- Ensure articles reference AI-assisted work features and benefits appropriately
- Articles ready for your review and editing

### Out of Scope

- Publishing articles to Medium or LinkedIn (you'll handle this)
- Social media promotion campaigns beyond the two platforms
- Video, podcast, or other multimedia content
- Engagement tracking or analytics
- SEO optimization or paid promotion strategies
- Translations or localization

## Context

### Related Documentation

- `README.md` - AI-assisted work overview and core concepts
- `agents/work-management/README.md` - Work management system features
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Integration patterns that could be highlighted

### Related Work Items

None (first private work item)

### Related Code

- `agents/work-management/` - Work management agent system to reference in articles
- `agents/image-management/` - Image processing workflows that could be featured

## Notes

- This is a private work item (WIP-001) - content drafts and planning will remain local
- Final published articles can reference the AI-assisted work repository (public)
- Article topics should balance technical depth with accessibility
- Enterprise Architect content should address real pain points (cognitive load, complexity management, architectural decision tracking)
