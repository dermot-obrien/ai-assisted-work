# Initiative Progress Tracking
#
# Initiatives are strategic containers that group related Work Items.
# Unlike Work Items, Initiatives do NOT have activities, tasks, or locks.
# Progress is tracked by monitoring the status of child Work Items.
#
# ID CONVENTIONS:
#   Initiative (shared):  IN-{NNN}   e.g., IN-001, IN-042
#   Initiative (private): INP-{NNN}  e.g., INP-001, INP-003
#
# STATES:
#   proposed   - Identified, scope being defined. No Work Items yet.
#   active     - Work Items being created/progressed.
#   on_hold    - Paused. Existing Work Items may remain.
#   completed  - All Work Items done, outcomes achieved.
#   done       - Verified and closed.
#   cancelled  - Abandoned. Reason documented.
