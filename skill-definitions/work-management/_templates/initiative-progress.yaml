# Initiative Progress Tracking
#
# Initiatives are strategic containers that group related Work Items.
# Unlike Work Items, Initiatives do NOT have activities, tasks, or locks.
# Progress is tracked by monitoring the status of child Work Items.
#
# ID CONVENTIONS:
#   Initiative (shared):  IN-{NNN}   e.g., IN-001, IN-042
#   Initiative (private): INP-{NNN}  e.g., INP-001, INP-003
#
# STATES:
#   proposed   - Identified, scope being defined. No Work Items yet.
#   active     - Work Items being created/progressed.
#   on_hold    - Paused. Existing Work Items may remain.
#   completed  - All Work Items done, outcomes achieved.
#   done       - Verified and closed.
#   cancelled  - Abandoned. Reason documented.

# === IDENTITY ===
initiative_id: IN-NNN
title: "{Initiative Title}"
status: proposed            # proposed | active | on_hold | completed | done | cancelled
owner: null                 # Person or agent responsible for strategic direction

# === TIMESTAMPS ===
created: "{ISO-8601-timestamp}"
updated: "{ISO-8601-timestamp}"

# === TIME HORIZON ===
target_start: null          # Target start quarter, e.g., "2026-Q1"
target_end: null            # Target end quarter, e.g., "2026-Q3"

# === WORK ITEMS ===
# Reference Work Items by ID. The Work Item's own progress.yaml is the source of truth.
# Status here is a convenience mirror — update when checking Initiative status.
#
# The initiative_id field on each Work Item's progress.yaml is the CANONICAL membership
# indicator (source of truth). This work_items array is a CONVENIENCE CACHE maintained
# by periodic sync (e.g., Housekeeper scanning for initiative_id back-pointers).
work_items:
  # - id: WI-NNN
  #   title: "{Work Item title}"
  #   status: planning         # Mirrors the WI's current status
  #   path: "change/work-items/WI-NNN-{name}/"

# === ROOT WORK ITEM (optional) ===
# Domain-specific integrations may designate one work item as the "root"
# that holds foundational artifacts (e.g., a research DAG, architecture baseline).
root_work_item: null            # e.g., WI-032

# === ARTIFACTS ===
artifacts:
  scope: "./scope.md"
  notes: null                # Set to "./notes.md" if created

# === NOTES ===
# Optional structured notes for status tracking
status_notes: null           # Brief note on current status, e.g., "Waiting on WI-005 API redesign"
on_hold_reason: null         # Reason if status is on_hold
cancelled_reason: null       # Reason if status is cancelled
