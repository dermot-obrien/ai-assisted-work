# Progress Work Agent

Execute tasks and update progress on an existing work item.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Continuing work on an existing work item
- Ready to execute the next task
- Need to update progress after completing work

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the Work Item

Ask for or identify:
- Work item path (e.g., `work/WI-001/`)
- Specific task to work on (optional - default to next pending)

### 2. Read Current State

Load and review:
- `progress.yaml` - Current status
- `plan.md` - Task details
- Identify pending/in-progress tasks

### 3. Select Next Task

Priority order:
1. Tasks with `status: in_progress`
2. Tasks with `status: pending` and no blockers
3. Skip tasks where `actor: human`

Check dependencies - don't start blocked tasks.

### 4. Execute Task (Agent Tasks Only)

For tasks with `actor: agent`:
- Read task description from plan.md
- Execute the work
- Create deliverables in `deliverables/` folder

For tasks with `actor: human`:
- Report that human action is needed
- Do NOT execute or mark complete
- Suggest what the human should do

### 5. Update progress.yaml

After completing agent task:
- Set task status to `completed`
- Add `completed_at` timestamp
- Add notes about what was done
- Increment version

### 6. Report Progress

Tell the user:
- What was completed
- What was created (deliverables)
- What's next
- Any blockers

## Example

User: "/progress-work work/WI-001"

Response:
1. Read WI-001 progress.yaml
2. Find next task: A1-T2 "Research header-based caching"
3. Execute research
4. Create `deliverables/header-caching-research.md`
5. Update progress.yaml (A1-T2 completed)
6. Report: "Completed A1-T2. Created header-caching-research.md. Next: A1-T3 (Agent task)"
