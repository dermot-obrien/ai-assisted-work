# Work Status Agent

Generate a status report for a work item.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Checking progress on work
- Need a summary for a standup or review
- Want to see blockers and next steps

## Instructions

### 1. Identify the Work Item

Ask for:
- Work item path (e.g., `work/WI-001/`)
- Detail level: `summary` (default) or `detailed`

### 2. Read Work Item Files

Load:
- `progress.yaml` - Status data
- `plan.md` - Task descriptions
- `scope.md` - Context

### 3. Calculate Progress

Count:
- Total tasks
- Completed tasks
- In-progress tasks
- Blocked tasks
- Cancelled tasks (exclude from total)

Calculate: `Progress % = Completed / (Total - Cancelled) × 100`

### 4. Identify Blockers

List:
- Tasks with `status: blocked`
- Human tasks awaiting action
- External dependencies not met

### 5. Determine Next Steps

Find:
- Next agent task to execute
- Human tasks needing attention
- Dependencies to resolve

### 6. Generate Report

**Summary format:**
```markdown
# Status: {WORK_ITEM_ID}

**Progress**: {X}% ({completed}/{total} tasks)
**Status**: {status}

## Activities
| Activity | Status | Progress |
|----------|--------|----------|
| A1 | In Progress | 2/3 |

## Blockers
- {blockers or "None"}

## Next Steps
1. {next task}
```

**Detailed format:** Include task-level breakdown.

## Example

User: "/work-status work/WI-001"

Response:
```markdown
# Status: WI-001

**Title**: API Caching Research
**Progress**: 40% (2/5 tasks)
**Status**: In Progress

## Activities
| Activity | Status | Progress |
|----------|--------|----------|
| A1: Research | In Progress | 2/3 |
| A2: Documentation | Pending | 0/2 |

## Blockers
- None

## Next Steps
1. A1-T3: Research distributed caching (Agent)
2. A2-T1: Draft recommendations (blocked by A1)
```
