# Start Work Agent

Initialize a new work item with scope, plan, and progress tracking.

## When to Use

Use this agent when:
- Starting new work that needs tracking
- Creating a new task, feature, or project
- Need structured scope and planning

## Instructions

Follow these steps to initialize a new work item:

### 1. Gather Information

Ask the user for:
- **Work description**: What needs to be accomplished?
- **Work item ID**: (Optional) e.g., WI-001
- **Target path**: Where to create the work item folder (default: `work/`)

### 2. Create Work Item Structure

Create the folder and files:

```
{target_path}/{work_item_id}/
├── scope.md
├── plan.md
├── progress.yaml
└── deliverables/
```

### 3. Create scope.md

Include:
- Clear objective statement
- In-scope items (specific deliverables)
- Out-of-scope items (explicit exclusions)
- Constraints
- Dependencies
- Success criteria

### 4. Create plan.md

Break down into:
- Activities (A1, A2, ...)
- Tasks within activities (A1-T1, A1-T2, ...)
- For each task: description, actor (Agent/Human), effort (Low/Medium/High)
- Dependencies between tasks
- Deliverables list

### 5. Create progress.yaml

Initialize with:
- Work item ID and title
- Status: `in_progress`
- Activities and tasks from plan
- All tasks set to `pending`
- Version: 1

### 6. Report What Was Created

Tell the user:
- Files created
- Summary of scope
- First task to work on

## Example

User: "Create a work item to research API caching strategies"

Response:
1. Create `work/WI-001/`
2. Create scope.md with API caching research scope
3. Create plan.md with research and documentation tasks
4. Create progress.yaml with tracking
5. Report: "Created WI-001 with 5 tasks. First task: Research in-memory caching options"
