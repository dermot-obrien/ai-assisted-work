        notes: "Verified: Cursor rules (aiaw-*), Claude commands (aiaw-*), GitHub prompts (aiaw-*), and GitHub Copilot delta file (aiaw-*) all use consistent naming. Note: CLAUDE.md, INTEGRATION.md show examples with bare command names but these are conceptual documentation, not tool configurations."
